        A guy and a girl were driving down the road when they accidentally ran over a rabbit. <br>
    Panicked, the guy grabs an aerosol can, jumps out, and rushes to the rabbit.<br>
    He sprays the rabbit from head to toe, in which it sprang back to life.<br>
    It hopped a few feet and turned back to wave at the guy and girl.<br>
    It hopped a few more feet and turned back to wave again.<br>
    Hopped again a few more feet, turned to wave once more. <br>
    "Wow, what was in that can???" asked the girl<br>
    The guy held the can up, with a glimmer in his eye <br>
    "Hare spray. Revives dead hare and gives it a continual wave."<br><br><br>
